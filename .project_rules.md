# Project Development Rules & Guidelines

## 1. Feature Development Workflow
- **Branching**: Always create a new git branch for each new feature or bugfix (e.g., `feature/add-goal-tracking` or `bugfix/fix-xirr-calc`).
- **Pull Requests**: Even for solo development, use pull requests (PRs) to review and test new features before merging to `main`.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test new features locally before merging. Never merge untested code to `main`.
- **Code Review**: If collaborating, require at least one review before merging. For solo, self-review PRs for clarity and completeness.
- **No Overwriting**: Never overwrite or remove working features when adding new ones. Refactor with care and always test backward compatibility.
- **Documentation**: Update documentation (README, features list, etc.) with every new feature or change.

## 2. Database Migration & Data Preservation
- **Schema Changes**: Use migration tools (e.g., Prisma Migrate) for all database schema changes. Never edit the database schema manually in production.
- **Data Preservation**:
  - Before running any migration, always back up the current database (use `prisma db pull` and export data if needed).
  - Use migration scripts that preserve existing data (e.g., use `ALTER TABLE` instead of `DROP TABLE`).
  - Never drop tables or columns containing important data without a backup and a clear migration plan.
- **Migration Testing**: Test all migrations on a local/dev copy of the database before applying to production.
- **Seed Data**: Keep seed scripts up to date, but never overwrite user data during seeding. Use conditional seeding or separate dev/prod seed scripts.

## 3. General Coding & Collaboration Rules
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g., `feat: add goal tracking UI`, `fix: correct XIRR calculation`).
- **Code Style**: Follow consistent code style (TypeScript strict mode, Prettier, ESLint). Run format/lint before committing.
- **Feature Flags**: For experimental features, use feature flags or keep them in separate branches until stable.
- **Backups**: Regularly back up both code and database, especially before major changes.
- **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, and tasksâ€”even for solo projects.
- **Changelog**: Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` to record all significant changes, features, and fixes.

## 4. Data Safety & Recovery
- **Backups**: Always back up the database before migrations or major updates.
- **Recovery Plan**: Document recovery steps in case of accidental data loss (e.g., how to restore from backup).
- **No Forced Resets**: Never use destructive commands (`DROP TABLE`, `DELETE FROM ...`) in production without a backup and explicit confirmation.

## 5. Deployment & Production
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive data (API keys, DB passwords) to git. Use `.env.local` or environment variables.
- **Production Migrations**: Apply migrations to production only after successful local/dev testing and backup.
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor app and database health. Set up alerts for errors or downtime if possible.

---

**Summary:**
- Develop features in isolation, test thoroughly, and merge only when stable.
- Always preserve and back up data before making changes.
- Document all changes and follow a systematic, version-controlled workflow.
- Prioritize data safety and code quality at every step.
